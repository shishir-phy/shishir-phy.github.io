## About Me


Hello, I am Sakibul Islam Shishir. I am self-motivated, fast learner and I know my limits. I don't quit any challenge, I just keep working until it is done. I have a major problem and that is, I can not stop till my project/work is completely done. I do not believe in luck what I believe is in self-motivation and self-belief. I do not dream only, I make them come true. I have done several projects of both Physics and computer related stuff. I love open source; I believe in open source; Besides, I am a super fast learner; Currently I am a student of Physics at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh.
